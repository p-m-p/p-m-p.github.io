## TypeScript vs JavaScript module resolution

TypeScript generally has the same import syntax as [JavaScript modules][javascript-modules] with additional features
from CommonJS that aren't supported in JavaScript modules.

Take this basic example of a library module structure.

```shell
.
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── feature
│   │   ├── Component.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

With TypeScript it's possible to import from the directory via it's index file or from another file without
the extension.

```ts
import { Component } from "./feature";
import Component from "./feature/Component";
```

JavaScript modules require the full path and the file extension.

```js
import { Component } from "./feature/index.js";
import Component from "./feature/Component.js";
```

To export JavaScript modules from the compiled TypeScript all import statements need to use the ESM syntax. To do this
the TypeScript configuration option for `module` needs to be set to `nodenext` as does `moduleResolution` (see
[Module resolution for libraries][module-resolution]).

You'd be easily mistaken here to think that compiling with other module settings work fine when consuming the library
with a bundler that doesn't apply the strict ESM resolution algorithm but when used with Node.js it will result in
module import errors.

Here's an example of a minimal TypeScript configuration for compiling to JavaScript modules.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "lib": ["node"],
    "module": "nodenext",
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
    "target": "esnext"
  }
}
```

It seems weird importing `.ts` and `.tsx` files with a `.js` extension, and there are other ways to fix the import
paths via plugins for bundlers like ESBuild and Rollup, but it does at least make the intent explicit.

## Packaging library modules

A common solution for exposing library modules is to use a bundler to create a single entry point. This is fine, and
possibly even preferred, for small packages but on a larger scale for packages with many modules exporting them
individually will help to reduce unused JavaScript and optimise build performance through [tree shaking][tree-shaking].

### Build options

If the compiled JavaScript files are relative to package.json they could be imported from the file system path.

```js
import { Component } from "myLib/feature/index.js";
```

It can get messy with this approach, having the compiled files strewn across the project during development. Some of
this can be overcome with [Git ignore][git-ignore] rules and use of the [files configuration][npm-files] in package.json
but it also means a key advantage of the module pattern is lost, [information hiding][information-hiding].

Node.js modules are able to provide a map of [package entry points](entry-points) in package.json to expose only the
public modules. When using this approach the compiled JavaScript modules can be output to a separate build directory.

Here's an example package.json with entry points for the JavaScript modules compiled to a directory named `dist`.

```json
{
  "name": "myLib",
  "type": "module",
  "files": ["dist"],
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.js"
    "./feature": "./dist/feature/index.js"
  }
}
```

Now it's possible to import the package modules from the named entry points, noticeably without the file name and extension.

```js
import { ComponentA } from 'myLib/componentA'
```

### Automated entry point generation

Maintaining the entry points manually will be a burden that likely becomes a source of errors with keeping things in sync.
Automating the generation of the package entry points removes this risk but presents a new problem, the need to update
package.json.

Generating the entry points and updating package.json could run as a [prepublish][pre-post-scripts] phase, a
[pre-commit hook][pre-commit-hook] or on a build server. Given there is a separate `dist` directory another
approach is to create a package.json in that directory and publish the package from there.

This Node.js script generates the entry points and writes a new package.json file in the `dist` directory. All public
modules under the `src` directory contain an `index.ts` file and this is used as the entry point.

```js
// generateExports.js
import { copyFile, readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { join } from "path";
import { glob } from "glob"; // npm install -D glob

// Assumes the script is in the project root and the TypeScript
// files have been compiled into a directory named dist
const root = import.meta.dirname;
const dist = join(root, "dist");

// Read package.json from the project root
const packageJson = JSON.parse(
  await readFile(join(root, "package.json"), "utf8"),
);

// Extend any manually added named exports
const exports = { ...packageJson.exports };

// Search for all index files in src directory and add
// named exports for the generated types and imports
for (const index of await glob("src/**/index.ts")) {
  const exportPath = index.replace(/^src(.*?)\/[^/]+$/, ".$1");

  exports[exportPath] = {
    types: `${exportPath}/index.d.ts`,
    import: `${exportPath}/index.js`,
  };
}

// Write the published package.json into the dist directory
await writeFile(
  join(dist, "package.json"),
  JSON.stringify(
    {
      ...packageJson,
      exports,
    },
    null,
    2,
  ),
  "utf8",
);

// Copy other files required in the published package
for (const file of ["README.md", "LICENCE"]) {
  await copyFile(join(root, file), join(dist, file));
}
```

This script can be run during the build and publishing of the library. Everything in the `dist` directory can
be ignored from source control and now there's no risk of forgetting to update the entry points or exposing
library internals that may be subject to change in the future.
